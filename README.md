# DermaDetect Pro 🩺📱  
A Deep Learning-Based Mobile Application for Skin Disease Detection  

## 📌 Overview  
**DermaDetect Pro** is an AI-powered mobile healthcare application that detects and classifies various skin diseases using real-time image analysis. Built using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), TensorFlow Lite, and Android, this project aims to provide early dermatological diagnostics through an accessible and user-friendly interface.

## 🚀 Features
- 🔍 **Skin Disease Classification**: Detects common conditions such as acne, eczema, psoriasis, and melanoma.  
- 📷 **Real-time Image Capture**: Snap or upload an image from your phone.  
- 🧠 **On-Device Inference**: Runs the CNN model using TensorFlow Lite for fast, offline predictions.  
- 📊 **Medical History Tracking**: Stores and retrieves user scan history securely.  
- 🩺 **Treatment Suggestions**: Offers basic precautions and dermatologist guidance.  
- 🔐 **User Authentication**: Firebase-backed login and registration system.

## 🧪 Model Training

- Custom-labeled dataset of skin disease images  
- Image augmentation techniques (flipping, zoom, contrast)  
- CNN with Conv2D, MaxPooling, and Dense layers  
- Achieved **~80% classification accuracy** on validation data  
- Converted to `.tflite` model for Android deployment
